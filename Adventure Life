<P style="color:BlanchedAlmond;">TIPS TO BE MORE ADVENTURES</P>
<UL>
<P style="color:RoyalBlue;"><I>Ask your friends to remind you that you are trying to be more adventurous.
Put a twist on something you’ve been doing for a while. Cook an exotic meal. Wear something out of character. Ask yourself, “How can I do this differently?”
Fear and anxiety might be holding you back in life. Seek professional help if you are struggling.
New people have the potential to teach you something new that can open your life to adventure.
Talk to people. Their stories of adventure can be almost as good as being on one yourself.
Always be on the lookout for new things to do. Film a documentary. Take a dance class. Meditate with Buddhist monks.
Every adventure you go on results in an interesting story to tell. People love a great story.
Find a vantage point atop a hill or at the ocean that has a great view. It will remind you there is a big world out there full of adventure.
Get fit. Many adventures require physical exertion.
Try something you've never done before and have fun doing it.</I></P>
